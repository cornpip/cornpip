## 😊 About Me

I am an AI/ML Engineer specializing in computer vision.

I work end-to-end from model development to inference,
across on-device and production environments.

With a strong startup mindset, I turn experimental ideas into
practical AI systems with real-world impact.

## 🛠 Core Capabilities

__AI & Computer Vision__
- Image processing and feature extraction
- Model development, fine-tuning, and evaluation (TensorFlow, PyTorch, data curation & augmentation)
- Production inference pipelines:  
  model conversion & optimization (TFLite, on-device inference)  
  end-to-end execution (pre → inference → post),  
  designed with performance, consistency, and maintainability in mind

__Application & Platform__
- Mobile: Flutter, Android
- Web & APIs: React, Spring, NestJS, Node.js
