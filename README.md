## 🚀 Who Am I?

I enjoy taking on new challenges and striving to create a positive impact in the world.

Problem definition isn’t just a simple step; it’s a distinct and creative part of engineering.  
By breaking things down and looking at them closely, I start to find hints that lead to a solution.  
This process brings clarity, which helps me get to the core of the problem — and that’s something I’m especially good at.
