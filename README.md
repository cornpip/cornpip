## 🚀 Who Am I?

I enjoy taking on new challenges and striving to create a positive impact in the world.

Problem definition isn’t a simple step; it’s a distinct and creative part of engineering.  
The clarity it brings is the foundation of every solution I build.

## 💡 What I Do Best

I design and build end-to-end services across web, mobile, and AI(Computer Vision) — turning ideas into real-world products.
